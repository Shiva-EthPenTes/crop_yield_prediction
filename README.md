Title : AI-based Crop Yield Prediction and Farming Optimization System
Introduction:

Agriculture is a fundamental pillar of the economy, especially in rural areas. However, smallholder farmers often face challenges such as unpredictable weather, poor soil conditions, and inefficient farming techniques, leading to low yields and food insecurity. With advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), it is now possible to predict crop yields accurately and provide data-driven farming recommendations. This report outlines the development of an AI-based solution that leverages weather patterns, soil health, and crop management practices to improve agricultural productivity and reduce hunger.
