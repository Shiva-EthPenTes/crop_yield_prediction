Title : AI-based Crop Yield Prediction and Farming Optimization System
Introduction:

Agriculture is a fundamental pillar of the economy, especially in rural areas. However, smallholder farmers often face challenges such as unpredictable weather, poor soil conditions, and inefficient farming techniques, leading to low yields and food insecurity. With advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), it is now possible to predict crop yields accurately and provide data-driven farming recommendations. This report outlines the development of an AI-based solution that leverages weather patterns, soil health, and crop management practices to improve agricultural productivity and reduce hunger.
Problem Statement:

Many rural communities depend on agriculture but face challenges such as unpredictable climate, 

poor soil health, and lack of access to expert farming knowledge. This leads to inefficient farming 

practices, low crop yields, and food insecurity. 
Objective:

To design and implement an AI-driven solution that predicts crop yields and provides actionable recommendations for improving farming practices using data on weather, soil conditions, and agricultural methods.
Why This Problem?

Rural farmers often lack access to real-time agricultural data and expert advice, which results in poor crop management. By offering AI-based insights, we can bridge this information gap, increase productivity, and help fight rural hunger.
